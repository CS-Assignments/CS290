                    <p>This is our first assignment in cs290 and we have to make a website and host it. I will be using just html to create it and GitHub Pages to host the website. Along side the main page, there will be a blog page that explains what we learned and how we put it use in our assignments. Plan for this website is to make it look nice and use everything I've learned in the past week. I also want to be able to use git commands for vcs instead of the git gui which I'm used to. :)</p>

                    <p>I've just finished the project and I've learned a number of new things. I learned how to use lists (like this one here) and to use hyperlinks. I was a little intimidated by the git commands but I picked them up pretty quickly and now I'm commiting changes all the time! It's definitely easier than copying code on to a USB and transferring it or using a shared drive when I want to code on my desktop instead of my laptop. Today I made the mistake of making changes on one machine without pulling the latest copy, and I learned how to use git stash and git shash pop which I'm not sure how it works but it is very useful. :)</p>

                    <p>This is our second project and it was fun in a challenging way. We learned to use CSS to style our websites and it's helped me update the design of the blog page. This project asked us to look at reference images and gifs and recreate the styling effects. I had to do some research but most of it was stuff we had already learned in class, we just had to use it cleverly. It was a little finicky, expecially when we set stuff to auto but I managed to fix those issues by the end. Overall, this was a really fun project! :)</p>

                    <p>This was definetly a tough project. We had to actually make out website responsive, this meant making buttons and input fields do stuff. We learned about listeners which can be used in a number of ways. Some cool ways they can be used are to trigger an event when a letter is typed or when the mouse moves. I had to do some research on array and found some method like push() and pop(0 that helped me out. If I had to pick the hardest part of this assignment, it would be actually saving the original twits. At first I was saving them using findElementByClassName but that made a object not an array which I learned the hard way. So I had to make 2 arrays that contained the twit and author name which could later be used to create new twits. I also had to clear the existing twits and readd all the saved oes everytime I created a new query. This was a satisfying assignment. :)</p>

                    <p>I really really liked this project, it was simple and I thought it was a nice end to the whole twiter replica project. It was a little frustrating when I was importing the file contents and I was messing up the relative and absolute paths. The ./ ../ and / get tricky sometimes. I didn't have to gogle much because I had notes as well as the sample code from classes. It's funny because I'm learning React alongside the class and whenever I have a question or something stumps, we magically go over those concepts in class. It happened again today when Rob talked about the scripts in the package.json file. :) :) :)</p>
